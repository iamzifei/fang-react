## How to build and run the project

* run `npm install && bower install` for dependencies
* create data/db folder under project root
* run `sh start-db.sh` to start mongodb
* `cd` to the project root in terminal, run `npm run watch`
* open another terminal window/tab, `cd` to the project root and run `gulp`
* run `sh import-suburb.sh` to import suburb table, you may need to change the database name in the shell script

## Testing data import

call `http://localhost:3000/api/load` to load testing data, you only need to do this once

## Mongodb command tips

* run `mongo` to get into the mongodb command shell
* run `use nef` to select database 'nef'
* run `db.getCollectionNames()` to list all collections in the database
* run `db.property.find()` to list all data in collection 'property'
* run `db.property.drop()` to delete the collection 'property'

## Branching strategy

* please create a branch for each feature, branch name should be `feature\<BRANCH NAME>` or `bugbix\<BRANCH NAME>`
* use pull request to merge back to the master branch
* master branch for deployment
* tag the production version
